                            Good question. As you follow all of the rules described in this policy (the "Rules"), VShojo, Inc. ("We") will not chase after you with a stick. In fact, We will even grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable, limited license for you to use, display and create derivative works based upon any of the IP, as long as it is STRICTLY for non-commercial (except as specifically provided below) community use. We reserve the right to deny anyone the use of IP at any time, for any reason, petty or not, or even no reason, including when We decide, in our sole and absolute discretion, that you are using our IP in a way that doesn't jive. If we deny you the right to use our IP, you must stop developing, publishing, or distributing your Project immediately.

                            TL;DR - If you're gonna make something, don't paywall it, charge people for it, or try to generate any kind of revenue using the IP, UNLESS that revenue is from promoting the Project in videos, streaming, etc. OR if you talked to us and got a license agreement first

                            You may not create mass produced commercial projects (fanmade items such as etsy, fanart prints at conventions, and other small run items are fine), or projects that crowdsources any portion of its funding, Projects that involves a business or legal entity, or Projects where you gate the content with a paywall (e.g., Patreon, YouTube Premium, OnlyFans, etc.) without a written license agreement from us. But like any good rule, there is an exception! We'll allow individuals to promote their Projects on websites, streams, or videos and passively generate revenue through appropriate advertisements, including pre-roll ads, ad breaks, and sponsor ad overlays. No inappropriate ads, and We are the ones who decide what is inappropriate. However, pre-existing assets such as stream footage used in an non transformative way is not eligible for pre, mid and post roll ads on Youtube as well as other revenue generating sources (IE you can't just post clip compilations and monetize them, however a streamer review, a original song about a vtuber featuring some images of her in the music video, or a weird conspiracy video about a stream is 100% fine).

                            Be original. That's what people want to see. It's no fun if you just copy existing stuff and try to pass it off as your own. Add some of yourself into it. Just adding some light commentary to existing content (like adding subtitles or rewatching vods while adding very little commentary), isn't going to cut it. Please try to make an original contribution to the community. Trust me, if you put the work into making something original, people will love it. We reserve the right to use services that identify our content automatically to prevent cannibalization of existing content.
